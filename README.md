# Sporting Beat

AI-automated sports blog, currently covering **Formula 1** and **cricket**. A
Python scraper collects raw event facts, Gemini turns them into original articles
+ cover images, an admin app reviews/publishes them, and a Next.js blog serves
the published posts with SSG/ISR.

Adding a sport means four things, and skipping any of them produces
sport-blind output rather than an error:

1. an adapter in `scraper/src/sources/` that returns `sport: "<name>"`
2. the value added to `Sport` in `packages/types`, the `sport` enums in
   `packages/db/src/models/`, and `VALID_SPORTS`/`VALID_FORMATS` in
   `scraper/src/items.py`
3. a `SPORT_BRIEFS` entry in `packages/ai/src/gemini.ts` (prompt voice) and a
   `SCENE_QUERIES` entry in `packages/ai/src/pexels.ts` (cover imagery)
4. a `SPORT_META` entry in `apps/blog/lib/site.ts` (labels, URL slug, blurb,
   data credit)

Head-to-head sports fill `teams` with exactly two names. Field sports (a race
grid) leave `teams` empty and put the finishing order in `standings` instead —
`hasResults()` in `packages/types` is what decides preview vs report, not the
presence of `playerPerformances`.

## Structure

```
apps/admin   - review/edit/approve dashboard (Auth.js login), port 3011
apps/blog    - public blog, SSG + on-demand revalidation, port 3000
packages/db  - Mongoose connection + schemas (raw_matches, posts, admin_users)
packages/types - shared TypeScript types
packages/ai  - Gemini text/image generation + Cloudinary upload
scraper/     - Python scraper (runs locally, or via GitHub Actions cron in prod)
```

## First-time setup

```bash
pnpm install

# create your admin login (email/password)
cd apps/admin && pnpm seed-admin you@example.com "your-password" && cd ../..
```

Fill in the missing Cloudinary values in `apps/admin/.env.local` and
`apps/blog/.env.local` (`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`).

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm dev   # runs both apps via turbo (blog on :3000, admin on :3011)
```

The admin port is 3011 rather than 3001 because a sibling project on this
machine holds 3001 and 3002. Three places must agree if you change it:
`apps/admin/package.json` (`dev` script), `AUTH_URL` in
`apps/admin/.env.local`, and `ADMIN_BASE_URL` in `scraper/.env`. A stale
`AUTH_URL` doesn't fail loudly — login just redirects to a dead port.

Scraper (separate, Python):

```bash
cd scraper
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Data sources

**Formula 1 — `scraper/src/sources/f1_races.py`** (the productive source).
Reads the [Jolpica](https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1) JSON API, the maintained
successor to Ergast: a JSON contract rather than HTML, so nothing breaks when
the site is restyled. One race becomes one `raw_matches` document; completed
rounds carry the full classification (position, driver, constructor, finishing
time or retirement reason, points) so Gemini writes reports rather than
speculation.

Its `robots.txt` sets `Allow: /` for the wildcard agent alongside
`Content-Signal: search=yes,ai-train=no`. We honour `ai-train=no` — race facts
are reference input for original prose, never training data. The licence asks
for attribution, which is rendered on every race article and in the footer via
`SPORT_META.motorsport.dataCredit`, not merely stored. **Check the upstream
terms before running ads against this content**: factual results aren't
copyrightable, but Ergast-lineage data has carried non-commercial expectations.

Two API quirks the adapter handles: `limit` is capped at 100 regardless of what
you ask for (so a season's ~480 result rows need paging, and a single race can
straddle a page boundary), and championship standings are only quoted for the
*upcoming* race — printing today's table inside a report on round 3 would be an
anachronism.

**Cricket — `scraper/src/sources/allt20_fixtures.py`**, scraping
https://allt20.asia/fixtures (Asian Legends League Season 2). That site's
robots.txt allows all bots and its pages are server-rendered HTML.

Its `/results` page still says "No results yet" even though the published
schedule (30 Jul – 10 Aug 2026) has passed and every fixture is still flagged
`upcoming`, so only fixtures exist — no scorecards or player stats. All 15
cricket dispatches are therefore previews. The tournament also lists 21
fixtures, but 6 of those are ceremonies and playoff slots whose teams are still
`—`; the adapter skips them deliberately (`len(teams) < 2`) rather than letting
Gemini preview "Rank 1 vs Rank 2".

`example_source.py` is an unfilled template kept as a starting point for adding
another source. Note that ESPN Cricinfo (403s all automated requests via its
CDN) and Cricbuzz (`Disallow: /` for generic bots) were both checked and are
not scrapeable.

`src/fetcher.py` handles robots.txt compliance, throttling and retry/backoff —
the three Scrapy downloader-middleware behaviours worth having at this size.
`src/items.py` validates each scrape before it reaches MongoDB (Scrapy's item
pipeline role). If this grows to many sites or thousands of pages, move to
Scrapy proper rather than extending these: its scheduler, request fingerprinting
and concurrency handling are the hard parts to reimplement.

## Content pipeline

1. Scraper seeds `raw_matches` (status: `new`) in MongoDB.
2. It (or a manual `curl`) triggers `POST /api/generate` on the admin app with
   header `x-cron-secret: $CRON_SECRET` — this runs Gemini text + image
   generation and writes `posts`. One call handles `BATCH_SIZE` (5) events, and
   **contested events are selected first** so a rate-limited free-tier batch is
   spent on reports rather than speculative previews.
3. Posts scoring `>= AUTO_PUBLISH_THRESHOLD` (0.85, see `apps/admin/lib/publish.ts`)
   auto-publish; everything else lands in the admin dashboard as `pending` for
   manual review (edit / approve / reject / regenerate).
4. Approving a post notifies the blog app (`POST /api/revalidate`) so the new
   page appears without a full redeploy.

### Cover images

`createCoverImage` tries three sources in order:

1. **Pexels** — commercially licensed stock, credited on the article and linked
   in the footer as the licence asks. Needs a free `PEXELS_API_KEY`.
2. **Gemini image generation + Cloudinary** — original artwork. Gemini's free
   tier grants **no image quota** (`limit: 0` on every image model, verified
   against the live API), so this needs a paid plan plus the two missing
   Cloudinary values (`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`).
3. **`/placeholder-cover.svg`** in each app's `public/`.

Cover scenes are chosen per sport (`SCENE_QUERIES` in `pexels.ts`) — Pexels has
no photography of this league or of a named driver, so the variety comes from
the kind of moment depicted. A missing entry silently yields cricket photos on
an F1 article.

Images from the scraped source site are **never** used as covers. The scraper
records their URLs in `raw_matches.sourceImages` as provenance only — they are
the tournament's copyrighted photography and its logos are also trademarks, and
editing them would produce a derivative work rather than avoid the rights issue.
That is the same reason the pipeline generates prose from facts instead of
rewriting source articles.

### Gemini output quirks

Two failure modes cost whole articles before they were handled, both in
`packages/ai/src/gemini.ts`:

- **`confidenceScore` ignores the requested scale.** The prompt asks for 0.0-1.0
  and the model has returned `1.9`, which the `Post` schema rejects outright
  (`max: 1`) — the article was generated, then thrown away. `normalizeConfidence`
  rescales the obvious 0-10 / percentage cases and clamps the rest; anything
  unparseable becomes 0, routing the post to manual review rather than
  auto-publishing on a score we don't trust.
- **Occasional runaway JSON.** Despite the response schema, the model sometimes
  degenerates into repetition and returns ~1.4 MB of unterminated JSON. A
  `SyntaxError` from `JSON.parse` is therefore treated as transient and retried
  alongside 429/503.

Model names are pinned in `packages/ai/src/gemini.ts`. Google retires models
for new API keys fairly aggressively — `gemini-2.5-flash` and
`imagen-4.0-generate-001` were both already unavailable during setup. If
generation starts 404ing, list what the key can actually reach:

```bash
curl -s "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

## Deploying

- Two separate Vercel projects: `apps/admin` and `apps/blog` (set the Vercel
  project's root directory accordingly).
- Copy the env vars from each app's `.env.local` into that Vercel project's
  environment variables — `BLOG_BASE_URL` on the admin project must point at
  the deployed blog URL, and vice versa isn't needed but `REVALIDATE_SECRET`
  must match on both.
- GitHub Actions cron (`.github/workflows/scrape.yml`) needs repo secrets:
  `MONGODB_URI`, `ADMIN_BASE_URL` (deployed admin URL), `CRON_SECRET`.
- Repo should be public for unlimited free GitHub Actions minutes.
